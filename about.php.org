            <h1>History of Epsilon</h1><p>After the end of World War I, our society woke up to see a world in disarray. A result of this awakening was the expansion of the Scouting movement. Along with this movement was the founding of the Alpha Phi Omega Service Fraternity at Lafayette College in Pennsylvania in 1925. It was founded upon the principles of the scouting movement to "assemble those who have had experience and training under the Scout Oath and Law... to develop friendship, to encourage service, and to enable its members to become leaders of America's youth through character building, citizenship, college spirit and manly strength." Alpha Phi Omega is based on this statement with leadership, friendship, and service as our three cardinal principles.<br />
<br />
Soon after the first chapter was founded, it quickly expanded to three other campuses. In less than two years, the fraternity then expanded to the school that is now known as Truman State University. Being the fifth chapter this chapter was called the Epsilon Chapter.<br />
<br />
The Epsilon Chapter of Alpha Phi Omega was founded on December 13, 1927 by ten young men, who were all former scouts. Ever since, Epsilon has been a leader both at the national level of the fraternity, and on the campus of Truman. Some of the service projects that Epsilon has worked on in its first fifty years included running Red Cross drives, putting up squirrel boxes on campus, being tour guides for visit days, and helping out at registration.<br />
<br />
In 1977 the Epsilon Chapter celebrated its fiftieth anniversary. This was an unusual event for the chapter with a memorial being placed on the Truman Quad dedicated to the Alumni of the Epsilon Chapter, and our first female member of Epsilon, Mary Ann Wolf, was activated. Admitting women to our chapter opened a new era to our chapter's history.<br />
<br />
Today Epsilon is one of the strongest organizations on the Truman State University campus. Its membership included former president of the Student Senate. It is also the largest non-honor group on Truman's campus, with approaching 200 members. Epsilon's service program now includes programs with the Salvation Army Food Pantry, Red Cross Blood Drives, Camp Silver Meadow, Ray Miller, and Twin Pines Retirement Community. Through friendship and service, Epsilon is poised to lead the Kirksville and Truman communities into the twentieth century.<hr/>
