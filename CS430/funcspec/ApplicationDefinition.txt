	Thomas tried to have pledge trainers fill out Google doc with all 
		information regarding pledges, req. etc.
		PT's should be able to do this
		VP should be able to see this
	
	We should be able to store Big/Little relationships
	
	PT's should be able to see info about their small groups
	
	Attendance perhaps not so useful for pledges
