<h1>Murfin Plaids</h1>

<p>The Murfin Plaid award recognizes members of the Epsilon chapter of Alpha Phi Omega who exemplify devotion to rendering service in the specific area of scouting and youth services.  Actives, alumni or advisors are eligible to receive this award.  This award is unique in that Murfin Plaid recipients may only be selected by three-fourths consent of the current Murfin Plaid recipients. The Murfin Plaids were first awarded at Epsilon's formal on April 9, 2011.  This award is presented to recipients at Epsilon's annual formal; it is a plaid insignia tab bearing a golden fleur-de-lis, and is worn near the heart.</p>

<p>The Murfin Plaid award bears the namesake of Russell W. Murfin, one of the Founding Fathers of AFW-Epsilon. A Kirksville native, Mr. Murfin was a beloved advocate for Epsilon's ideals and mission, and a continual presence at chapter functions throughout his life.  Epsilon's spring 1981 and 1985 pledge classes are named in his honor.  His wife, Sue Murfin, became an honorary chapter member in 1983.  In 1986, Epsilon awarded Mr. Murfin, at age 79, a Distinguished Service Key.  He is the only Founding Father of Epsilon to receive this award.  Mr. Murfin passed away on Sept. 30, 1995; he was 88 years old.</p>
